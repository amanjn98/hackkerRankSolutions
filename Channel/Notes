Use channels when you need safe communication between goroutines, especially when passing data or signals.
Use buffered channels when you want to decouple the send and receive operations and allow goroutines to work with multiple
values without immediate synchronization.
Use wait groups when you need to synchronize a group of goroutines and ensure they all complete their work before proceeding.
Use wait groups for basic synchronization scenarios with minimal complexity and when the number of goroutines to wait for is fixed.
