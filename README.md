# hackkerRankSolutions

This repo will contains solutions to the problem of the hackkerrank

List all buildin Golang data types.

Conversion/assertion:

Should know about functions to convert primitive data types.

Empty Interface:

Slices:

Candidate has good theoretical knowledge of slices.

Custom types:

Was able to create a type for custom error.

Arrays:

GO Basic Concepts

GO Advanced Concepts

Theoretical and practical background in Go.

Able to resolve all practical tasks.

Such topics: - data types - strings - bytes vs rune - map - value vs pointer receiver - channels (blocking, buffered chan, read from closed channel) - data race - troubleshooting out of memory issue. - implementing interface - Mutex vs RWMutex - slices referencing/dereferencing, slice appending - project layout; map(nil map reading) - interface type/value - chan(closed chan reading) - internal pkg â€“ pprof.


OOP in go (embedding):

OOP in go (empty interfaces):

OOP in go (empty interfaces) comment

Candidate should explain how we can use empty interface and how to cast and should know what interface consists of.

Concurrency (goroutines):

Concurrency (race conditions):

Concurrency (race conditions) comment

Was able to detect and fix data race.

Concurrency (channels):

Concurrency (channels) comment

Should able to fix deadlock and explain chan behavior.

Concurrency (WaitGroup):

Concurrency (WaitGroup) comment


SQL/other Databases

Should know about ACID transactions. Should describe eventual consistency.

Agile

Should know theoretical and practical background.

Design patterns

Web Communication Protocols

HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC.

Microservice Architecture Pattern

Should know micro-services and monolithic architecture styles.

How to stop a running goroutine, the difference between buffered and unbuffered channels.

Should know the difference between value and reference types, mutable and immutable types, function vs methods.

Experience in SQL, Agile process, or cloud technologies.

Lacks knowledge of some aspects of Go

Should know about SQL or NoSql databases / Couchdb

Microservices, protocols, cloud


Sample Coding

Candidate can be asked an output and modify the program if necessary to fix the error:


1. Slice initialization and append program -

2. interface and type assertion check -

3. goroutines, slices , local goroutine variable and race condition -


Perfect candidate would be:

1)Can manage stress-well.

2)Polite, Friendly, Good comm.skills.

3) Could create, build and execute GO Project

3) Implement concurrent stack operations in successfully. Should understand race conditions and deadlocks.

4) Good knowledge of how distributed, cloud native enterprise web applications work (Can ask to define current project)

5) Design patterns: Successfully implement worker pool and synchronization.

6) Web Components and Frameworks: Demonstrate good knowledge of web components frameworks and communications



GO types

Builtin types:

Differentiate between value and reference types.

Conversion/assertion:

Empty Interface:

Slices: difference between the slices and arrays

Custom types:

BFS: Used when you want to find the shortest path
DFS + Backtracking: Used when you want to brute-force all possible combinations.
